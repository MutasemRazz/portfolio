# 🛢️ Oil & Gas Engineering Projects

Engineering projects and field work completed during my internship at Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL).

---

### 🔧 Production Optimization & Cost Savings
- Coordinated 63 well maintenance projects with multidisciplinary teams, increasing production by 502.9 bbl/d (~$7.3 million annually).
- Led planning and execution of a battery consolidation project, achieving $6.5 million in annual OPEX savings.

---

### 🧪 Engineering Trials & Data-Driven Improvements
- Conducted tracer studies and optimized cross-linking agent trials to enhance production performance.
- Developed operational sequences that reduced well treatment costs by 5x.
