# 🛰️ Hybrid Rocket Development – Ouroboros I & II

As part of the SOAR rocketry team, I contributed to the design, simulation, manufacturing, and launch of **Ouroboros I & II**, hybrid-fueled rockets developed for high-power competition flights.

---

### 🏅 Achievements
- 🥇 **First Place** in Hybrid Rocket Category at **Spaceport America Cup** in New Mexico.
- Successfully launched multiple rockets at Launch Canada and international competitions.

---

### 🧩 My Role: Airframe & Recovery Lead
- Led a cross-functional team on structural and recovery subsystem development.
- Coordinated with propulsion, avionics, and testing teams to maintain alignment with project milestones.
- Ensured all airframe components met structural and thermal performance requirements.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Processes
- **CAD**: SolidWorks for full rocket and subsystem modeling
- **Simulation**: ANSYS Workbench for FEA and CFD
  - Stress testing on fins, couplers, and internal supports
  - Heat transfer simulations for oxidizer isolation and nozzle systems
- **Manufacturing**:
  - Fiberglass body tubes
  - Carbon fiber fins
  - Internal aluminum components
- **Testing**: Pressure testing, parachute deployment, and ground validation

---

### 📊 Key Results
- Reached target altitude and performance criteria in multiple launches
- All recovery systems deployed successfully
- Structural integrity confirmed through analysis and post-flight inspections
