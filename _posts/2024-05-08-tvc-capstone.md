# 🚀 Thrust Vector Control System – Capstone Project

Our capstone project developed a thrust vector control (TVC) system for the SOAR rocketry team, specifically designed for solid rocket motors using a jet vane approach.

---

### 🏆 Achievement
🏅 **Won First Place** in the Multidisciplinary Engineering Category at the University of Calgary Engineering Design Fair.

---

### 🧩 My Role: Structures Lead
- Designed and optimized the TVC system for static ground testing on a vertical test stand.
- Conducted FEA to verify structural integrity under operational thrust loads.
- Managed manufacturing of motor integration parts and load cell mounting hardware.
- Coordinated test stand assembly, load cell integration, and vendor communication.
- Led four successful hot fire tests validating mechanical and software systems.

### ⚙️ Tools & Methods
- **Design**: SolidWorks, 3D printing
- **FEA**: ANSYS Workbench
- **Testing**: Ground hot-fire tests on solid rocket motor
- **Project Management**: Cross-team coordination and manufacturing planning
