# 🔥 CFD Analysis of Scramjet Flow Dynamics

This project involved simulating high-speed compressible flow through a scramjet engine to analyze shock wave formation, heat transfer, and flow behavior during supersonic combustion.

---

### 🎯 Objective
To model internal flow characteristics of a scramjet using OpenFOAM, capturing the effects of shocks, boundary layers, and thermal gradients at Mach 2+ conditions.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Workflow
- **Solver**: OpenFOAM compressible solvers for high-speed flow
- **Mesh Generation**: Custom 2D geometry for isolating scramjet intake and combustion chamber
- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - Supersonic inlet
  - Subsonic outlet
  - Adiabatic and high-temp walls
- **Post-Processing**: ParaView for visualizing pressure, temperature, and velocity fields

---

### 📊 Key Results
- Captured oblique shock structures and stagnation points
- Observed flow separation near combustion walls due to thermal gradients
- Velocity and pressure profiles matched expected theoretical trends

---

### 🖼️ Visuals
*To be added:*  
- Pressure contour plots  
- Mach number gradients  
- Shock and boundary layer visualizations
