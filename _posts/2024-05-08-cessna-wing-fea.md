# 🛠️ Finite Element Analysis of a Cessna 172 Wing

This project involved a comprehensive structural analysis of a simplified Cessna 172 wing under realistic aerodynamic conditions using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

---

### 🎯 Objective
Evaluate the wing's structural behavior under various flight conditions — including deformation, stress distribution, and vibration — to support aeroelastic performance evaluation.
